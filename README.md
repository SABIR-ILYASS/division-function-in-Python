The algorithm presented in **Python** is an optimized algorithm to determine the divisors of an integer

The idea of this algorithm is based on **the fundamental theorem of arithmetic** which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.
