# division-function-in-Python
The algorithm presented in python is an optimized algorithm to determine the divisors of an integer

The idea of this algorithm is based on the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which states that every integer greater than 1 can be represented uniquely as a product of prime numbers, up to the order of the factors.
